# Description

Simple test benchmark on python-numpy dot-producting two random vectors vs C++
libs dot-producting two random vectors. Libs tested: 

* Eigen
* Yet to be boost and Armadillo

TODO: also try rust libs on linear algebra if any, make sure same random vectors used

# Usage

To run C++ version just:

```make && ./random_array```

To run Python version just

```python ./random_array_dot.py```
